# Kermit
8-DOF robot spider

Simulation folder contains code for simulation of various actions using PyBullet. Code is not complicated but also not clean. Somewhat legible in most cases:).

Move each leg individually using sliders (MoveLegs.py)

Robot walks rather chaotically using trot gait where two diagonal legs are raised at a time (MoveWalk.py)

A more controlled walk using a stable gait where one leg lifts at a time (MoveWalk2.py)

Robot turns right using a stable gait (TurnRight.py)
