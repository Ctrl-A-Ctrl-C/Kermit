# Kermit
8-DOF robot spider

Simulation folder contains code for simulation of various actions using PyBullet. Code is not complicated but also not clean. Somewhat legible in most cases:).

MainSim.py incorporates all motions into a single file and allows user to control the model using a Bluetooth Controller (in this case an Xbox 1 controller).

The model is Spider.urdf.
